Dr. Emil Henry Hoch, born August 30, 1929, died January 17, 2014, after a prolonged illness. He passed peacefully with family at his side. He is survived by daughter Heidi Lynda Hoch of Castile, NY; daughter Holli Dyanne Hoch (John) Hamner of Greenvile, SC; granddaughter Sarah Elizabeth Hamner (Geoff) Loose of Nashville, TN; grandson LT Joel Lawrence (Chrissie) Hamner, USN of Aiea, HI; and three great-grandsons, Ashton Luke, Hunter Logan Hamner and Levi Hewes Loose; also surviving are a brother Herman Frederick Hoch of Castile, NY; a sister L. Ruth Hoch Brethen of Warsaw, NY; brother Richard Walter (Hilde) Hoch of Angola, NY; brother Manfried L. Hoch of Racine, WI, and many nieces, nephews, great-nieces, great-nephews and great-great nieces and nephews. He is predeceased by his wife of 61 years, Eleanor June Conklin Hoch, parents Heinrich \"Henry\" Hoch and Elisabeth Marie Hoeckelsberger Hoch and grandson Joshua Luke Hamner. Dr. Hoch was known for his generosity, integrity, and strength. He began his education in a one-room schoolhouse in Western New York and went on to teach and develop university programs on five continents. For ten years following high school his employment included Agway, Sylvania, Cataraugus Mill, and the B. &amp; O. Railroad. Later he earned an undergraduate degree at Buffalo State, a Masters' Degree at Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana, and a doctorate in education from the University of Maryland. He taught in Montgomery County (MD) public schools, and in 1966 returned to teach industrial arts at Buffalo State. He became department head, also serving in the State University Senate in Albany, eventually serving as the SUNY Senate president. For many years before retirement, he was Director of International Education at Buffalo State. His international educational outreach included teaching in Ethiopia and Korea, and establishing international student exchange programs in Italy, England, and Australia. Together, he and his wife Eleanor enjoyed hosting dozens of international students in their home. Dr. Hoch was a hands-on \"Renaissance man.\" He was a published poet, a weekend pilot, a bee-keeper, a builder, a photographer, a gardener, a designer and maker of assistive devices for the physically impaired, and he donated more than 50 gallons of blood. He put others first and loved helping people. He always said, \"We can learn more from listening than from talking.\" Though often quiet, he was known for engaging anyone in conversation from a child to the emperor of Ethiopia. Neighborhood children often knocked on the door to ask, \" Can Mr. Hoch come out and play?\" He will be remembered as a steadfast man of quiet faith who remains loved, admired, and cherished by his family and community. Visitation and a funeral was January 21 at HAMON-WATSON FUNERAL HOME, with burial at Grace Cemetery, Castile.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
